    <h2>Impact of AI in our daily day life</h2>

    <p>
        Day by day AI (Artificial Intelligence) are becoming more important in our daily lives. Everyday we are using it more and more without realizing it. AI is now affecting our daily lives like it's part of us, and part of our economy.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this generation we always ask AI on things we are curious about, we even ask AI to calculate things for us and we don't even need to use the calculator. AI is becoming smarter day by day, and we use it for our daily lives. It is not really negative for AI to be this smart and I think it'll be better in the future, and we can use it to adapt. But for now, it is advancing too much to the point that some people can't keep up and some things are becoming more expensive because of AI. Though I think without relying too much on AI, it is good for us especially that there is so much that you can ask AI and the things that AI can do like:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Asking it for ingredients and step by step cooking</li>
        <li>AI can teach you your lessons</li>
        <li>It can translate</li>
        <li>It can summarize or paraphrase for you</li>
        <li>It can help provide workout routines</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        There are just billions of possibilities on what AI can do even now. Just imagine what AI can do in the future. Though I can't help but worry for our future, because even now we're already relying too much on AI. Overall I think AI really helps us a lot, I wish for it to advance to the point that it can fix hunger problems and things that we humans can't fix.
