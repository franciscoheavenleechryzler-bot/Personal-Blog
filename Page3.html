        Last year, I learned how to ride a bike, and it became an experience I will not forget. At first, it was really hard for me to balance. Still, I pushed myself to learn because I needed to lose weight.
    </p>

    <p>
        On my third day of learning how to bike, I was still barely able to balance properly. Even so, my friends made me ride a bike all the way to MOA, which was honestly scary. While riding, I almost got crushed by a truck twice because I was still struggling with control and balance. I also crashed into something near a canal on the way home. Those moments were scary and made me want to quit, but they also helped me learn faster.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, my experience with biking was good despite all the struggles. It taught me a lot of things and not to give up easily. In the end, learning how to ride a bike was worth it.
