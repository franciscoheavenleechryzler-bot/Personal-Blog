    <h3>The Journey of my Career Goals</h3>

    <p>
        Before starting college, I thought I already knew what I wanted for my future. I was interested in game development, and at one point, I also dreamed of starting a business. However, as I continued studying and learning more about technology, my goals slowly changed. Right now, I want to focus on learning SQL little by little while I am in college and use it as a practical skill to earn money and prepare for my future plans.
    </p>

    <p>
        I chose SQL because I realized how important databases are in almost every system and business today. Many applications, websites, and companies rely on data, and SQL plays a big role in managing that data. Instead of rushing to learn everything at once, I want to build my knowledge gradually while balancing my college studies. My current goals related to SQL and my future plans include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Learning the basic to intermediate concepts of SQL step by step while I am in college</li>
        <li>Practicing SQL through small projects or simple database tasks to gain experience</li>
        <li>Using my SQL skills to earn income while studying, even through entry-level or part-time opportunities</li>
        <li>Gaining real-world experience that will help me understand how systems and businesses work</li>
        <li>Using what I earn and learn as a foundation for starting a business in the future</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        My career goals have changed over time, and I have learned that this is a normal part of growth. While I once focused on game development and business, I now see SQL as a practical and valuable skill that fits my current situation. By learning SQL while in college, I can slowly build experience, earn money, and prepare myself for bigger opportunities. In the future, I hope to use both my technical skills and experience to pursue a business and create something meaningful.
